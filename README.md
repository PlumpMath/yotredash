# Contributing

There is a git pre-commit hook in the `hooks` directory which runs `cargo fmt -- --write-mode=diff` before commit, which will fail the commit if it doesn't match the format guidelines. You can link the hook into your `.git` directory either by running the `hooks/link` script or with `ln -sf` on your own.

Come discuss this project on [zulip](https://foss.kity.wtf)!
